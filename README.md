UFO Analysis

![(The Truth is Out There)](https://john10roberts.github.io/UFO/)

 ## Overview of Project
To create a web page that will allow users the ability to search through all the UFO sightings in a dataset. This page will provide users the ability to filter that dataset on multiple criteria at the same time specifically we will be adding the ability to filter not only on date but city, state, country, and shape. 

### Results
The following is a final screen shot of the web page.

Steps to Search:
1 - User goes to the page
2 - User enters a value on any field on the screen

4 - Enter as many values as needed to filter the list to the users liking

### Summary
The initial web page has been updated with the additional functionality requested. While the page is very user friendly one of the biggest drawbacks is that a user can enter any value into the search boxes. There is no validation that happens and that could cause a user to enter values that are not contained in the table. In a future release validation should be added to ensure that users cannot search for values not contained in the table. Additionally, I think another search box should be added that will allow a user to search on the comments. This would allow them the ability to try to get a match on similar experiences.
